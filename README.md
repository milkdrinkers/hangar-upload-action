### Configuring Files

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

`files` specifies which files to upload for what platforms:

- `<array>` - JSON array holding you configurations.
  - `<entry>` - JSON object holding a configuration entry. 
    - `path` a file path to what you wish to upload. Suppports advanced [Glob](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob) patterns.
    - `platforms` - JSON array holding a list of platforms.
      - `<platform>` - A platform entry, either `PAPER`, `VELOCITY` or `WATERFALL`.
    - `url` boolean which determines wether to use `path` or `externalURL`. Default, `false`.
    - `externalURL` url to the file to download, used instead of `path`.

#### Upload JAR File
```json
[
  {
    "path": "build/libs/MyPlugin.jar",
    "platforms": ["PAPER"]
  }
]
```

#### Multiple Platform Support
Mark `.jar` compatibility with multiple platforms.

```json
[
  {
    "path": "build/libs/MyPlugin.jar",
    "platforms": ["PAPER", "VELOCITY", "WATERFALL"]
  }
]
```

#### External Download Link
Point to a external download link.

```json
[
  {
    "platforms": ["PAPER"],
    "url": true,
    "externalUrl": "https://github.com/user/repo/releases/download/v1.0.0/plugin.jar"
  }
]
```

#### Multiple Files
Upload different `.jar` files for each platform. 

```json
[
  {
    "path": "build/libs/MyPlugin-Paper.jar",
    "platforms": ["PAPER"]
  },
  {
    "path": "build/libs/MyPlugin-Velocity.jar", 
    "platforms": ["VELOCITY"]
  }
]
```

#### Use Glob Pattern
This will upload any `.jar` files that exist under any directory `/build/libs/`, excluding files with names ending in `-sources.jar` & `-javadoc.jar`.

```json
[
  {
    "path": "**/build/libs/!(*-sources|*-javadoc).jar",
    "platforms": ["PAPER"]
  }
]
```

### Configuring Dependencies

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

#### Platform Dependencies

`platform_dependencies` specifies which platforms your plugin supports.

- `<object>` - JSON object holding you configuration.
  - `<platform>` - The platform this configuration is for, either `PAPER`, `VELOCITY` or `WATERFALL`.
    - `<array>` a JSON array holding all the supported versions. Suppport

Supported Semver version patterns:
- Exact versions: `"1.20.4"`
- Minimum versions: `">=1.19"`
- Version ranges: `"1.16-1.18.2"`
- Minor version wildcards: `"1.20.x"`

```yaml
platform_dependencies: |
  {
    "PAPER": ["1.20.4", ">=1.19", "1.18.x"],
    "VELOCITY": [">=3.0.0"],
    "WATERFALL": [">=1.19"]
  }
```

#### Plugin Dependencies

`plugin_dependencies` specifies which dependencies your plugin supports.

- `<object>` - JSON object holding you configuration.
  - `<platform>` - The platform this configuration is for, either `PAPER`, `VELOCITY` or `WATERFALL`.
    - `name` a project slug, or when `externalUrl` is used, the external projects name.
    - `required` wether this dependency is required or not.
    - `externalUrl` optional URL to a plugin. If not set `name` will be used as a Project Slug.

```yaml
plugin_dependencies: |
  {
    "PAPER": [
      {
        "name": "Vault",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "name": "PlaceholderAPI", 
        "required": false,
        "externalUrl": "https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/"
      }
    ]
  }
```

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid API token"**
- Make sure your token is stored in GitHub Secrets
- Verify the token has upload permissions
- Check that the token hasn't expired

**"Project not found"**  
- Verify the `slug` matches your project's identifier on Hangar
- Ensure your project exists and you have upload permissions

**"Invalid version format"**
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3-beta`)
- Avoid special characters in version strings

**"File not found"**
- Check that the file path is correct relative to the workspace
- Ensure your build step completed successfully
- Verify the JAR file was actually created
